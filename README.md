# Stonepaperscissors

This is a game which we all have played in our chilhood. Participants say “rock, paper, scissors” and then simultaneously form their hands into the shape of a rock (a fist), a piece of paper (palm facing downward), or a pair of scissors (two fingers extended). The rules are straightforward:

Rock smashes scissors.
Paper covers rock.
Scissors cut paper.
